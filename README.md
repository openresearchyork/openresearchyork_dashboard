# Open Research at York Dashboard

The shiny app created by the Open Research Team (University of York) showcases open research at the University of York (UK) in an interactive dashboard.

Open Access data from Scopus is based on unpaywall.org. The scopus export file must contain the fields 'Open Access', 'Year', 'Correspondence Address', 'Source title', 'DOI' and 'Document Type'. The current version can be replaced (drag and drop if name is the same). The script combines scopus export data from all files starting with scopusUoY. Hence, naming of new scopus data (e.g. for new year) must also start with 'scopusUoY'. When new data is uploaded, the intermediate file 'TAYOAF_OAformat.csv' has to be updated. This happens automatically when the file is deleted.

The Transformative Agreement and York Open Access Fund data was collected by the Open Research team (University of York) and cross-checked with Scopus data to include the Publication type and correspondence address as a proxy for corresponding author affiliation.

Please let us know how you are using the visualisations and data (lib-open-research@york.ac.uk).
