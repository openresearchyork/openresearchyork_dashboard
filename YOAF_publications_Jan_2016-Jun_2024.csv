MM  The author has selected Nature's 'Guided OA' option for this paper. The paper is being considered for three journals: Nature Methods, Nature Communications, and Communications Physics. There are two fees involved: an 'editorial assessment' fee of £1890 and a 'top up APC' of £2170. See: https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/open-access/guided-open-access . The editorial assessment fee has to be paid even if the paper is rejected for publication. I asked UKRI if we could pay the editorial assessment fee, and they said we could only pay it if the paper went on to be published gold OA. This means that, if the paper is accepted, we'll pay both fees, but if not we won't pay anything. The two fees might be invoiced separately at different times. We can only pay the editorial assessment fee when we know that the paper has been accepted for publication. This might mean that the author's department pays it initially and we reimburse them when we hear that the paper's accepted. The paper had not yet undergone editorial assessment when the author emailed us last.
