# Open Research at York Dashboard

The shiny app created by the Open Research Team (University of York) showcases open research at the University of York (UK) in an interactive dashboard.

Open Access data from SciVal is based on unpaywall.org The file must contain the fields 'Open Access' and 'Year'. If a new version of the publication set is downloaded from SciVal, the current version can be replaced (simply drag and drop), whereby no changes to the document are required. The new document must also be called 'Publications_at_the_University_of_York_SciVal.csv'.
