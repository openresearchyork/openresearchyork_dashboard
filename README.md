# Open Research at York Dashboard

The shiny app created by the Open Research Team (University of York) showcases open research at the University of York (UK) in an interactive dashboard.

Open Access data from SciVal is based on unpaywall.org The file must contain the fields 'Open Access' and 'Year'. The current version can be replaced (drag and drop), whereby no changes to the publication set download from SciVal are required. The new document must also be called 'Publications_at_the_University_of_York_SciVal.csv'.

The Transformative Agreement data was collected by the Open Research Team (University of York) and cross-checked with Scopus data to include the Publication type and correspondence address as a proxy for corresponding author affiliation.

Please let us know how you are using the visualisations and data (lib-open-research@york.ac.uk).
